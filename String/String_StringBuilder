Strings are immutable.
Each time u try to change the value of String a new object will get created in heap memory and now reference variable will start pointing to it.

It can lead to high time complexity because heap will store all values.

String is not recommended if we have to make changes in a string by applying a loop cause it can create Quadratic Time Complexity.

time to copy a string ~ string length (n)
no. of times loop iterates ~ m
TC: (m*n)




Here comes in picture StringBuilder it do not creates new object it just makes changes in the values.
